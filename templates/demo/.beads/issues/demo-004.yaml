  Implement the ability to mark todo items as complete.

  ## Requirements
  - Clicking a todo toggles its completed state
  - Completed todos have visual distinction (strikethrough, muted color)
  - Completion state persists in localStorage
  - Users can un-complete a todo by clicking again

  ## Implementation Notes
  - Add click handler to todo items
  - Toggle `completed` boolean in todo object
  - Update localStorage after each toggle
  - Use CSS class for completed styling

  ## Dependencies
  - Requires demo-003 (add todo functionality) to be complete first
  - Builds on the todo data structure and localStorage pattern

  ## Test Specifications

  ### Unit Tests
  - `test_toggle_complete_updates_todo_state`
  - `test_toggle_complete_persists_to_localStorage`
  - `test_toggle_complete_can_uncomplete`

  ### Manual Verification
  - Click a todo → it shows as completed
  - Click again → it shows as incomplete
  - Refresh page → completion state preserved
