  Evaluate cloud sync options for todo persistence across devices.

  ## Research Topics
  - Firebase Realtime Database vs Firestore
  - Supabase as open-source alternative
  - Conflict resolution strategies for offline-first
  - Authentication requirements

  ## Questions to Answer
  - Do we need user accounts?
  - How do we handle merge conflicts?
  - What's the cost at scale?
  - Privacy implications of cloud storage?

  ## Why This is Parked
  This is a significant architectural decision that goes beyond MVP scope.
  We should validate the core todo functionality before adding complexity.

  ## When to Revisit
  - After MVP is complete and validated
  - If users request cross-device sync
  - When we have clearer requirements for multi-user support
