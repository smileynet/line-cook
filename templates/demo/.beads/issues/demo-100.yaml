  Collection of ideas and improvements to consider later.

  Items here are NOT ready for immediate work. They represent:
  - Future enhancements beyond MVP
  - Ideas that need more research
  - Nice-to-haves that aren't blocking anything

  ## How This Works
  Tasks filed under this epic (with priority 4) are automatically
  filtered out of `bd ready` results. They can still be explicitly
  selected via `/line:cook <task-id>` if you want to work on them.
