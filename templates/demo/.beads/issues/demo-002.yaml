  Users can perform basic todo management operations.

  ## User Stories
  - As a user, I can add a new todo item so I can track what I need to do
  - As a user, I can mark a todo as complete so I can track my progress

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] Input field accepts text for new todo
  - [ ] Pressing Enter or clicking Add creates the todo
  - [ ] New todos appear in the list immediately
  - [ ] Clicking a todo marks it as complete (visual indicator)
  - [ ] Completed todos remain visible but styled differently

  ## Technical Notes
  - Use localStorage for persistence
  - Keep state management simple (no external libraries for MVP)
