## Summary

**Convergent thinking phase: structure, scope, decompose.** Second phase of mise en place.

This phase transforms exploration into a structured, reviewable plan. Output is a YAML menu plan that can be converted to beads.

**Input:** Brainstorm document (optional) or direct requirements
**Output:** `docs/planning/menu-plan.yaml`

**STOP after creating menu plan.** Wait for user approval before committing.

## Process

### Step 1: Load Context

Look for planning context:

1. Check for context folders:
   ```bash
   ls docs/planning/context-*/README.md 2>/dev/null
   ```

2. **If context folder(s) found:**
   - Read README.md files, find non-archived ones
@IF_CLAUDECODE@
   - If multiple non-archived contexts, **use AskUserQuestion** to ask which one to use
   - Read the context README for problem, approach, and key decisions
@ENDIF_CLAUDECODE@
@IF_OPENCODE@
   - If multiple, ask the user which one to use
   - Read context README for problem, approach, key decisions
@ENDIF_OPENCODE@
   - Read `decisions.log` for rationale history

3. **If no context folder but brainstorm exists:**
   ```bash
   ls docs/planning/brainstorm-*.md 2>/dev/null
   ```
   - Read the brainstorm document
   - Use it as input for planning
@IF_CLAUDECODE@
   - Create a context folder from brainstorm content (see brainstorm Step 5b)
@ENDIF_CLAUDECODE@
@IF_OPENCODE@
   - Create a context folder from brainstorm content
@ENDIF_OPENCODE@

4. **If neither exists:**
   - Ask user for requirements directly
@IF_CLAUDECODE@
   - Consider if brainstorm phase would be valuable first
@ENDIF_CLAUDECODE@

### Step 2: Determine Scope

@IF_CLAUDECODE@
Based on the problem, determine the right scope:

@ENDIF_CLAUDECODE@
| Scope | Sessions | When to use |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Task** | <1 | Simple, clear deliverable |
| **Feature** | 1-3 | User-observable capability |
| **Epic** | 3+ | Multiple features, large effort |

@IF_CLAUDECODE@
**For tasks:** Skip menu plan, create bead directly
**For features:** Create single-feature menu plan
**For epics:** Create multi-phase menu plan

@ENDIF_CLAUDECODE@
### Step 3: Create Menu Plan

@IF_CLAUDECODE@
Build a structured breakdown in YAML format:

**Create `docs/planning/menu-plan.yaml`:**
@ENDIF_CLAUDECODE@
@IF_OPENCODE@
**Create `docs/planning/menu-plan.yaml`:**
@ENDIF_OPENCODE@

```yaml
phases:
  - id: phase-1
    title: "Phase 1: Foundation"
    description: "Core infrastructure for tmux integration and worktrees"
@IF_CLAUDECODE@
    duration: "Week 1 (4-6 sessions)"
@ENDIF_CLAUDECODE@

    features:
      - id: feature-1.1
        title: "Feature 1.1: Execute commands in tmux sessions"
        priority: 2
        user_story: "As a capsule orchestrator, I want to execute commands in tmux sessions so that I can programmatic control OpenCode TUI"
        acceptance_criteria:
          - "Can create/destroy tmux sessions"
          - "Can send commands with proper debouncing"
          - "Can capture session output"
@IF_CLAUDECODE@
        tracer_strategy:
          minimal_flow: "Create session -> Send command -> Capture output -> Destroy"
          layers: "Tmux wrapper -> Command execution -> Output capture"
          expansion: "Window management, pane splitting (deferred)"
@ENDIF_CLAUDECODE@

        tasks:
          - title: "Port tmux wrapper from gastown"
            priority: 1
            tracer: "Foundation layer - proves tmux integration works"
            description: |
              - Copy internal/tmux/tmux.go structure
              - Adapt for Capsule needs
            deliverable: "internal/tmux/tmux.go skeleton"
@IF_CLAUDECODE@
            reference: "~/code/gastown/internal/tmux/tmux.go"
@ENDIF_CLAUDECODE@
            tdd: true

          - title: "Implement session creation/destruction"
            priority: 1
            depends_on: ["Port tmux wrapper from gastown"]
            tracer: "Session lifecycle - proves basic management works"
            description: |
              - NewSession(name, workDir) function
              - KillSession(name) function
              - SessionExists(name) check
            deliverable: "Session management with tests"
            tdd: true
```

@IF_CLAUDECODE@
**See `docs/planning/menu-plan-format.md` for complete format reference.**

### Step 4: Add Feature Dependencies

Add `blocks` field to enforce sequential feature completion:

```yaml
features:
  - id: feature-2.1
    title: "Feature 2.1: Run missions in isolated worktrees"
    blocks: ["feature-1.2"]  # This feature blocks Feature 1.2
    # ...

  - id: feature-1.2
    title: "Feature 1.2: Basic CLI structure"
    blocks: ["feature-3.1"]  # This feature blocks Feature 3.1
    # ...
```

**Why sequential?**
- Maintains focus on one feature at a time
- Prevents context switching
- Ensures features are fully complete before moving on

### Step 5: Validate Feature Quality

Every feature MUST be user-facing. Validate:

| Check | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| **User interface** | Has CLI/API/UI for users to invoke |
| **User story** | Clear "As a... I want... So that..." |
| **Acceptance criteria** | 3-5 testable outcomes |
| **Smoke testable** | Can write end-to-end CLI tests |

**If you can't write smoke tests, it's not a feature** - it's infrastructure that should be tasks under a real feature.

@ENDIF_CLAUDECODE@
@IF_OPENCODE@
### Step 4: Hierarchy Structure

```
Epic (Phase)
├── Feature 1 (User-observable outcome)
│   ├── Task 1.1 (Implementation step)
│   ├── Task 1.2 (Implementation step)
│   └── Task 1.3 (Implementation step)
└── Feature 2 (User-observable outcome)
    ├── Task 2.1 (Implementation step)
    └── Task 2.2 (Implementation step)
```

@ENDIF_OPENCODE@
### Step 5b: Update Planning Context

If a planning context folder exists (`docs/planning/context-<name>/`):

1. **Update README.md:**
   - Set status to `scoped`
   - Add Scope section with phase/feature/task counts and feature list

2. **Update architecture.md:**
   - Add any new layer/constraint info discovered during scoping

3. **Append to decisions.log:**
   ```
   YYYY-MM-DD | scope | <decision> | <rationale>
   ```

### Step 6: Handoff

Output the menu plan summary:

```
MENU PLAN CREATED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

File: docs/planning/menu-plan.yaml

Phases: <N>
Features: <M>
Tasks: <L>

Breakdown:
@IF_CLAUDECODE@
  Phase 1: <title> (<X> sessions)
@ENDIF_CLAUDECODE@
@IF_OPENCODE@
  Phase 1: <title>
@ENDIF_OPENCODE@
    - Feature 1.1: <title>
      - <N> tasks
    - Feature 1.2: <title>
      - <N> tasks
@IF_CLAUDECODE@
  ...

Tracer Strategy:
  Feature 1.1:
    Minimal flow: <flow description>
    Layers: <layers>
    Expansion: <deferred items>
@ENDIF_CLAUDECODE@

REVIEW THE PLAN:
  1. Check hierarchy makes sense
  2. Verify each feature has:
     [ ] User story
     [ ] Acceptance criteria (3-5)
@IF_CLAUDECODE@
     [ ] Tracer strategy
@ENDIF_CLAUDECODE@
  3. Verify each task has:
     [ ] Tracer explanation
     [ ] Clear deliverable
@IF_CLAUDECODE@
     [ ] Dependencies listed
     [ ] TDD flag if applicable
@ENDIF_CLAUDECODE@
```

@IF_CLAUDECODE@
Then **use AskUserQuestion** to ask:

**Question:** "Menu plan created. How would you like to proceed?"
**Options:**
  - "Continue to /@NAMESPACE@finalize" — Convert plan to beads and test specs
  - "Review menu plan first" — Stop here, review docs/planning/menu-plan.yaml
  - "Done for now" — End the planning session

If user chooses "Continue to /@NAMESPACE@finalize", invoke `Skill(skill="@NAMESPACE@finalize")`.
Otherwise, stop and output the artifact file paths.
@ENDIF_CLAUDECODE@
@IF_OPENCODE@
Then ask the user how they'd like to proceed:

- **Continue to /@NAMESPACE@finalize** — Convert plan to beads and test specs
- **Review menu plan first** — Stop here, review docs/planning/menu-plan.yaml
- **Done for now** — End the planning session

Wait for the user's response before continuing. If user chooses to continue, run `/@NAMESPACE@finalize`.
@ENDIF_OPENCODE@

## Hierarchy Structure

@IF_CLAUDECODE@
**Three-tier hierarchy:**

@ENDIF_CLAUDECODE@
```
Epic (Phase)
├── Feature 1 (User-observable outcome)
│   ├── Task 1.1 (Implementation step)
│   ├── Task 1.2 (Implementation step)
│   └── Task 1.3 (Implementation step)
└── Feature 2 (User-observable outcome)
    ├── Task 2.1 (Implementation step)
    └── Task 2.2 (Implementation step)
```

@IF_CLAUDECODE@
**Mapping:**
- **Epic** = Phase (3+ sessions, multiple features)
- **Feature** = User-observable capability (1-3 sessions, multiple tasks)
- **Task** = Single implementation unit (< 2 hours, one tracer)

@ENDIF_CLAUDECODE@
---

## Task Sizing Guidelines

@IF_CLAUDECODE@
**Use tracer bullet thinking** - each task should be a vertical slice through relevant layers.

**Too Small** (combine into one tracer):
@ENDIF_CLAUDECODE@
@IF_OPENCODE@
**Too Small** (combine):
@ENDIF_OPENCODE@
- "Add import statement"
- "Create empty file"
@IF_CLAUDECODE@
- "Update comment"
@ENDIF_CLAUDECODE@

@IF_CLAUDECODE@
**Just Right** (single tracer, one session):
- "Define mission struct and state machine" (data layer)
- "Implement bead integration" (external interface layer)
- "Implement launch command" (orchestration layer)
@ENDIF_CLAUDECODE@
@IF_OPENCODE@
**Just Right** (single session):
- "Implement session management"
- "Add command execution"
- "Create CLI wrapper"
@ENDIF_OPENCODE@

@IF_CLAUDECODE@
**Too Large** (break into multiple tracers):
- "Implement entire mission lifecycle" -> Break into: state machine, launch, monitor, dock
- "Add all monitoring features" -> Break into: capture, detect, log, report
- "Complete Phase 1" -> Break into individual features
@ENDIF_CLAUDECODE@
@IF_OPENCODE@
**Too Large** (break down):
- "Implement entire lifecycle"
- "Add all monitoring features"
@ENDIF_OPENCODE@

---

@IF_CLAUDECODE@
## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Creating beads directly: Hard to review, edit, and discuss
- Too vague: "Implement monitoring"
- Too large: "Complete Phase 1"
- No deliverable: "Research tmux"
- Horizontal slicing: "Build entire UI layer"
- No tracer strategy: Tasks in random order
- "Internal features" with no CLI: "Feature: Manage worktrees" (no user interface)
- Features without smoke tests: If you can't smoke test it, it's not a feature

---

@ENDIF_CLAUDECODE@
## Example Usage

```
/@NAMESPACE@scope
```

@IF_CLAUDECODE@
This command will:
1. Check for existing brainstorm document
2. Determine scope (task/feature/epic)
3. Create YAML menu plan
4. Output summary for review
5. Wait for user approval before committing
