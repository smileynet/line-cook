# Test Specification: Add final summary output

**Bead:** lc-cnl

## Tracer

UX - proves summary formatting works

## Context

- LOOP COMPLETE header
- Total tasks executed
- Success count
- Failure count (if any)
- Remaining tasks (if stopped early)
- Elapsed time (if tracked)
- Git status (commits made)


**Deliverable:** Comprehensive final summary block

## Test Cases

| Input | Expected Output | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| TODO | TODO | Define based on tracer strategy |

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Define edge cases based on implementation
- [ ] Consider error conditions
- [ ] Consider boundary values

## Implementation Notes

These specs will be translated to language-specific tests during /cook RED phase.

Reference the tracer strategy to determine:
1. What minimal test proves the layer works?
2. What would be the simplest way to verify success?
3. What's the first thing that could go wrong?
