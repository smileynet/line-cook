# Test Specification: Create /line:loop command skeleton

**Bead:** lc-cnl

## Tracer

Foundation - proves command structure works

## Context

- Create commands/loop.md with YAML frontmatter
- Define allowed-tools (same as run.md)
- Add summary and process sections
- Document arguments ($ARGUMENTS for --max-iterations)


**Deliverable:** commands/loop.md skeleton with basic structure

## Test Cases

| Input | Expected Output | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| TODO | TODO | Define based on tracer strategy |

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Define edge cases based on implementation
- [ ] Consider error conditions
- [ ] Consider boundary values

## Implementation Notes

These specs will be translated to language-specific tests during /cook RED phase.

Reference the tracer strategy to determine:
1. What minimal test proves the layer works?
2. What would be the simplest way to verify success?
3. What's the first thing that could go wrong?
