description: |
  The validate_email() function in src/validation.py currently uses a
  placeholder implementation that only checks for "@" in the email.

  Replace with proper regex validation:
  - Use a standard email regex pattern
  - Handle edge cases (empty string, None)
  - Add corresponding tests in tests/test_validation.py

  This is a smoke test task for validating the Line Cook workflow.
