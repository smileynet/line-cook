{"id":"lc-xhu","title":"Research OpenCode session management and compaction capabilities","description":"Research OpenCode's capabilities for programmatic session management, compaction, and TUI control.\n\n## Research Questions\n1. Can OpenCode start new sessions programmatically?\n2. Does OpenCode support context compaction? Can it be triggered programmatically?\n3. **TUI Control**: Can OpenCode's TUI be controlled externally?\n   - IPC mechanisms (sockets, named pipes, stdin injection)\n   - PTY/terminal automation support (expect, tmux send-keys)\n   - Slash command triggering from outside\n   - Keyboard shortcut equivalents in API/CLI\n4. What hooks or APIs exist for session lifecycle?\n5. Can a single command start a new session AND begin new work?\n\n## Context: Claude Code Findings\n**Session Management:**\n- New sessions: `claude \"prompt\"` or `claude -p` (non-interactive)\n- Resume: `--continue` or `--resume \u003csession-id\u003e`\n- Chain sessions programmatically via `-p` flag\n\n**Compaction:**\n- Only manual `/compact` in interactive mode\n- No programmatic API to trigger compaction\n- PreCompact hook exists for observation only\n\n**TUI Control:**\n- NO external control of running TUI session\n- NO IPC, socket, or stdin mechanism\n- NO PTY/expect automation support\n- Design intentionally separates interactive vs programmatic modes\n- Hooks (SessionStart, PreToolUse, etc.) react to events but can't trigger commands\n\n**Recommended Pattern for Claude Code:**\nUse `-p` (non-interactive) + `--resume` to chain multiple programmatic invocations\n\n## Goal\nIdentify if OpenCode has equivalent or different capabilities, especially regarding TUI control that Claude Code lacks.","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"sambiggins@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-18T19:15:03.176199644-08:00","created_by":"Sam Biggins","updated_at":"2026-01-18T19:19:52.659753021-08:00"}
