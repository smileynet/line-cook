Additionally, diff-collector.py (_get_bead_detail)\nand plan-validator.py (_fetch_bead) manually duplicate run_bd_json\nlogic instead of importing the now-shared helper.\n\nContext:\nhelpers.py exists and is imported by all 6 scripts. Natural follow-up\nto add _validate_bead_id to helpers.py, and refactor _get_bead_detail\nand _fetch_bead to use run_bd_json. Not urgent — only reduces drift.","status":"closed","priority":4,"issue_type":"task","owner":"sambiggins@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-12T23:31:04.149470594-08:00","created_by":"Sam Biggins","updated_at":"2026-02-13T07:15:58.665359948-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-13T07:15:58.665359948-08:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"lc-7qb.5","depends_on_id":"lc-7qb","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-12T23:31:04.151279715-08:00","created_by":"Sam Biggins"}],"comments":[{"id":20,"issue_id":"lc-7qb.5","author":"Sam Biggins","text":"PHASE: COOK\nStatus: started","created_at":"2026-02-13T15:12:17Z"},{"id":21,"issue_id":"lc-7qb.5","author":"Sam Biggins","text":"PHASE: COOK\nStatus: completed\n\nSEMANTIC CONTEXT (for tidy summary):\nIntent: Eliminate copy-pasted _validate_bead_id across 4 scripts and duplicate run_bd_json logic in 2 scripts\nBefore: _validate_bead_id duplicated in kitchen-equipment.py, diff-collector.py, plan-validator.py, state-snapshot.py; _get_bead_detail and _fetch_bead manually reimplemented run_bd_json logic\nAfter: Single validate_bead_id in helpers.py imported by all 4 scripts; _get_bead_detail and _fetch_bead use run_bd_json\n\nFiles: 6 changed (helpers.py, kitchen-equipment.py, diff-collector.py, plan-validator.py, state-snapshot.py, test_helpers_unit.py)\nFindings: none","created_at":"2026-02-13T15:15:58Z"},{"id":22,"issue_id":"lc-7qb.5","author":"Sam Biggins","text":"PHASE: SERVE\nStatus: completed\nVerdict: APPROVED\nIssues: 0 found (8 polisher refinements, 0 to-file)\nSummary: Clean extraction of validate_bead_id and run_bd_json adoption.
