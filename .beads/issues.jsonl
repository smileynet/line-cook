Most relevant for line-cook:\n\n### Commit Hooks\n- **pre-commit**: Before commit message editor opens. Exit non-zero aborts commit.\n- **commit-msg**: After message entered. Can validate/modify message format.\n- **post-commit**: After commit completes. For notifications, no abort capability.\n\n### Push Hooks\n- **pre-push**: Before push to remote. Receives stdin with ref info. Exit non-zero aborts push.\n\n### Merge/Pull Hooks\n- **post-merge**: After git pull/merge completes. Good for syncing state.\n- **post-checkout**: After branch switch or file checkout.\n\n## Current State\n\nBeads already uses:\n- **pre-commit**: Flushes pending bd changes to issues.jsonl, stages the file\n- **post-merge**: Imports updated issues.jsonl after pulls\n\nbd doctor reports: 'Missing 1 recommended hook(s): pre-push'\n\n## Line-Cook Integration Opportunities\n\n### Option 1: Extend Beads Hooks (Recommended)\nLine-cook could leverage beads' existing hook infrastructure:\n\n**pre-push hook** (most valuable addition):\n- Warn if in_progress beads exist without recent commits\n- Enforce 'landing the plane' discipline\n- Could run bd sync automatically\n\n**post-commit hook** (nice to have):\n- Auto-sync beads after each commit\n- Track session activity for metrics\n\n### Option 2: Add Claude Code-Specific Hooks\nLine-cook already has Claude Code hooks (SessionStart, Stop, PreToolUse, PostToolUse).\nGit hooks would complement these for workflow outside Claude sessions.\n\n### Option 3: Use Hook Management Tools\nPopular frameworks:\n- **pre-commit** (Python): Language-agnostic, uses .pre-commit-config.yaml\n- **husky** (Node.js): Popular in JS ecosystem, .husky/ folder\n- **lefthook** (Go): Fastest, supports parallel execution, no runtime deps\n\nFor line-cook: Shell scripts or Go (like beads) preferred over adding Node/Python deps.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **Short-term**: Document how beads hooks integrate with line-cook workflow\n2. **Medium-term**: Add pre-push hook to warn about uncommitted work\n3. **Long-term**: Consider hooks that bridge git workflow and Claude Code sessions\n\nKey insight: Beads pre-commit already handles the critical 'flush before commit' case.\nThe main gap is pre-push enforcement of session completion discipline.","created_at":"2026-01-19T06:37:58Z"},{"id":38,"issue_id":"lc-6tu","author":"Sam Biggins","text":"PHASE: COOK\nStatus: completed\nSummary: Researched git hooks types, identified relevant hooks for line-cook workflow (pre-commit, pre-push, post-merge, post-commit), analyzed beads' existing hook implementation, and documented recommendations for integration.\nFiles: 0 changed (research task)\nFindings:\n- New task: Add pre-push hook to warn about uncommitted work\n- Improvement: Document beads hook integration in HOOKS.md","created_at":"2026-01-19T06:38:18Z"},{"id":39,"issue_id":"lc-6tu","author":"Sam Biggins","text":"PHASE: SERVE\nStatus: completed\nVerdict: approved\nIssues: 0 found (0 auto-fixed, 0 to-file)\nSummary: Research task completed with comprehensive findings.

{"id":"lc-872","title":"Release Process: Version bump and publish for core changes","description":"## Purpose\n\nStandardize the release process for Line Cook when core functionality changes. This ensures both Claude Code and OpenCode plugins are updated consistently.\n\n## When to Use This Process\n\nRun this process when making changes to:\n- Commands (commands/*.md, line-cook-opencode/commands/*.md)\n- Hooks (hooks/*.py, line-cook-opencode/src/*.ts)\n- Plugin manifests (plugin.json, package.json)\n- Core workflow logic\n\n**Skip for:** Documentation-only changes, CI/CD configs, .beads/ changes, test files.\n\n## Release Checklist\n\n### 1. Determine Version Bump\n\nUse semantic versioning:\n- **Patch** (0.4.5 → 0.4.6): Bug fixes, minor tweaks\n- **Minor** (0.4.5 → 0.5.0): New features, non-breaking changes\n- **Major** (0.4.5 → 1.0.0): Breaking changes\n\n### 2. Update Version in All Locations\n\n```bash\n# Claude Code plugin\n.claude-plugin/plugin.json          # \"version\": \"X.Y.Z\"\n\n# OpenCode plugin (TWO places!)\nline-cook-opencode/package.json     # \"version\": \"X.Y.Z\"\nline-cook-opencode/package.json     # \"opencode.version\": \"X.Y.Z\"\n```\n\n### 3. Commit Version Bump\n\n```bash\ngit add .claude-plugin/plugin.json line-cook-opencode/package.json\ngit commit -m \"chore: bump version to X.Y.Z\"\n```\n\n### 4. Push to Remote\n\n```bash\nbd sync\ngit push\n```\n\n### 5. Verify Updates Available\n\n**Claude Code users:**\n```bash\n/plugin update line  # Should show new version\n```\n\n**OpenCode users:**\n```bash\nopencode plugin install https://github.com/smileynet/line-cook  # Reinstall for update\n```\n\n**Local users:**\n```bash\ncd ~/line-cook \u0026\u0026 git pull\n./scripts/install-claude-code.sh   # Claude Code\n# OR\ncd line-cook-opencode \u0026\u0026 bun run build \u0026\u0026 ./install.sh  # OpenCode\n```\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- Version MUST be identical in all 3 locations\n- OpenCode has version in TWO places in package.json (root and opencode section)\n- Always bump version AFTER the functional changes are committed\n- Use conventional commit format: `chore: bump version to X.Y.Z`","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"sambiggins@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-19T10:16:02.462864632-08:00","created_by":"Sam Biggins","updated_at":"2026-01-19T10:17:08.167844018-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-19T10:17:08.167844018-08:00","close_reason":"Created release process documentation in AGENTS.md and OpenCode AGENTS.md"}
