{"id":"lc-k6i","title":"tidy should not ask user questions - file issues as beads instead","description":"The /tidy command currently asks the user questions about issues, documentation updates, etc. It should instead operate non-interactively: any errors, warnings, concerns, or clarifications discovered should be filed as beads (P3/P4) for later processing. This keeps the workflow moving and avoids blocking on user input.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"sambiggins@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-18T00:58:31.712558483-08:00","created_by":"Sam Biggins","updated_at":"2026-01-18T00:58:31.712558483-08:00"}
